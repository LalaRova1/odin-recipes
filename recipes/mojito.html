        <H1>The Real Mojito</H1>

        <H2>What is a Mojito?</H2>

        <p>A mojito is a classic highball drink that originated in Cuba. Not surprisingly, this cocktail uses ingredients indigenous to Cuba, including rum, lime, mint, 
            and sugar. The mixture is topped off with a little club soda to create a thirst-quenching libation. 
            It requires a bit more labor than many mixed drinks, as it involves first muddling fresh mint, lime, and sugar together to release the flavors. 
            But it's well worth it for a refreshing, fizzy, and mildly sweet rum cocktail that remains one of the most popular to this day. </p>
